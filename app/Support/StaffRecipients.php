/**
 * Resolves the staff who should receive an operational alert.
 *
 * When staff_email_routing is 'central' and a central email is configured, the
 * email copy is redirected to that single shared inbox - but individual staff
 * are still returned so they continue to receive their in-app (database)
 * notifications. Their notification's via() suppresses the mail channel in
 * central mode to avoid emailing them on top of the central inbox. Otherwise
 * every user holding the given permission (plus super-admins) gets their own
 * email and in-app copy.
 *
 * Defensive by design - a missing permission/role must never break the flow
 * (e.g. payment confirmation) that triggers the notification.
